In the vdem dataset, electoral turnout is the percentage of registered voters that cast a ballot during elections. The data is reported in percentages. The variable, online media fractionalization, was collected as survey responses, with 0 being a lot of media fractionalization, and 4 being no media fractionalization. The osp variation of this variable reports the data as a response from 0-4, which was what was used to crate the graphs below. Each visualization helps to show how online media fractionalization impacts electoral voter turnout. Originally, I hypothesizeed that more fractionalization might lead to less voter turnout, though throrugh these preliminary graphs, it is difficult to determine if the relationship is significant.

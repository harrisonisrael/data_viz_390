In the vdem dataset, electoral turnout is the percentage of registered voters that cast a ballot during elections. The data is reported in percentages. The variable, online media fractionalization, was collected as survey responses, with 0 being a lot of media fractionalization, and 4 being no media fractionalization. The osp variation of this variable reports the data as a response from 0-4, which was what was used to crate the graphs below. Each visualization helps to show how online media fractionalization impacts electoral voter turnout. Originally, I hypothesized that more fractionalization could either encourage more voters to vote, as shown in 2020 or it could discourage people from voting. Though throrugh these preliminary graphs, it is difficult to determine if the relationship is significant. In a time where news sources seem to be reporting different ideas and claiming them to be fact, it is critically important to understand how media might impact elections, and impact outcomes such as electoral turnout.

The scatter plot also uses another variable, the electoral democracy index. This variable examines to what extent the ideal of an electoral democracy is achieved, with 1 being a perfect electoral democracy, and 0 having no commonalities with electoral democracy. This variable showcases the level of democracy in a country, allowing the visual to demonstrate how democracy varies amongst both voter turnout and media fractionalization.

The violin plot shows the data sorted into specific categories based on fractionalization, and gives a slightly better idea at how the two variables are related. Those category of low fractionalization has the lowest average voter turnout and the smallest spread of the data.

The hex plot is a clearer version of the scatter plot, allowing the viewer to more easily see the relationship between media fractionalization and voter turnout.

The two maps show the distribution of the two variables by country. Countries that have more blue on both maps (like the United States) both have higher fractionalization and lower electoral turnout. Countries with more orange on both maps (like Australia) have lower fractionalization and higher electoral turnout.

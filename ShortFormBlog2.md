In the vdem dataset, electoral turnout is the percentage of registered voters that cast a ballot during elections. The data is reported in percentages. The variable, online media fractionalization, was collected as survey responses, with 0 being a lot of media fractionalization, and 4 being no media fractionalization. The osp variation of this variable reports the data as a response from 0-4, which was what was used to crate the graphs below. Each visualization helps to show how online media fractionalization impacts electoral voter turnout. Originally, I hypothesized that more fractionalization could either encourage more voters to vote, as shown in 2020 or it could discourage people from voting. Though throrugh these preliminary graphs, it is difficult to determine if the relationship is significant. In a time where news sources seem to be reporting different ideas and claiming them to be fact, it is critically important to understand how media might impact elections, and impact outcomes such as electoral turnout.

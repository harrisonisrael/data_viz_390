### A Lousy Visualization - From Bloomberg.com

This Bloomberg image is incredibly difficult to read. The dots for each country are incredibly small and the overall scale for the chart is very off, with most of the dots clumped around the bottom of the chart. You also are only able to see the label for one country at a time. While this does reduce clutter if the graph was otherwise labeled, it makes it nearly impossible to compare multiple countries. I would suggest that the graph adjusts its scale in order to make the relevant data more of a focus, as well as increasing the size of each country dot. I also would suggest limiting the number of countries on the chart in order to either add labels that are clear or to make comparisons between countries far easier.

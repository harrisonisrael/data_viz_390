# Visualization Blog 2 - Plotting Uncertainty

Uncertainty can be very important in visualizations and is necessary to determine whether results or trends are statistically significant. Below you'll find to graphs that demonstrate uncertainty in different ways. The first demonstrates President Biden's approval rating throughout 2021, with confidence intervals around each polling number. The second visualization shows the distribution of firearms per 100 people across regions. Not only does this graph show the distribution of the data, put also the mean and 95% confidence intervals.

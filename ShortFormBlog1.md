## Short Form Blog 1- What Happened to the "American Dream"?

For many years, the U.S. was home to the “American Dream”, where anyone could come to the land of opportunity to find success. America was a place of hope. Yet, that isn’t necessarily how most people would describe the country today. In a PBS poll, 40% of respondents said that the American dream was dead, while only 36% felt it was still alive. Why has that changed? Beyond being a hub for immigration and for people to come to the U.S. to achieve such dreams, people within the country also are unable to break the cycles of poverty and find the upward mobility that used to “define” the United States. When we look around at our communities, there is such a variety of problems with some neighborhoods having virtually no concerns, while others are plagued with systemic poverty. To get to the heart of issues like poverty, hunger, etc. it is imperative to understand how different communities leave individuals better or worse off. What are the characteristics that allow some individuals to break the cycle of low-income earnings? How does the place where someone grows up influence their future? Are some areas better than others? These questions are crucial for understanding the pathways to upward mobility in the United States and to figuring out why growing up in some communities seems to lend itself to more upward mobility than others.

My data comes from the Opportunity Atlas, created by Opportunity Insights, which is a non-profit, non-partisan organization from Harvard University. The team that developed this data is led by Raj Chetty, a Professor of Economics at Harvard and a pioneer in the economics of education and of equality. Specifically, I focused in on my home state of Massachusetts in order to work with a smaller data set and to see how upward mobility varied across the state. The data is quite comprehensive and is paired with U.S. census data in order to include demographic data, measurements for upward mobility, economic data in the state, etc.

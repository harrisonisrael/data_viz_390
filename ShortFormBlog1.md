## Short Form Blog 1- What Happened to the "American Dream"?

For many years, the U.S. was home to the “American Dream”, where anyone could come to the land of opportunity to find success. America was a place of hope. Yet, that isn’t necessarily how most people would describe the country today. In a [PBS poll](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/point-taken/american-dream-dead-alive/#poll), 40% of respondents said that the American dream was dead, while only 36% felt it was still alive. Why has that changed? Beyond being a hub for immigration and for people to come to the U.S. to achieve such dreams, people within the country also are unable to break the cycles of poverty and find the upward mobility that used to “define” the United States. When we look around at our communities, there is such a variety of problems with some neighborhoods having virtually no concerns, while others are plagued with systemic poverty. To get to the heart of issues like poverty, hunger, etc. it is imperative to understand how different communities leave individuals better or worse off. What are the characteristics that allow some individuals to break the cycle of low-income earnings? How does the place where someone grows up influence their future? Are some areas better than others? These questions are crucial for understanding the pathways to upward mobility in the United States and to figuring out why growing up in some communities seems to lend itself to more upward mobility than others.

My data comes from the Opportunity Atlas, created by Opportunity Insights, which is a non-profit, non-partisan organization from Harvard University. The team that developed this data is led by Raj Chetty, a Professor of Economics at Harvard and a pioneer in the economics of education and of equality. Specifically, I focused in on my home state of Massachusetts in order to work with a smaller data set and to see how upward mobility varied across the state. The data is quite comprehensive and is paired with U.S. census data in order to include demographic data, measurements for upward mobility, economic data in the state, etc.

The measure of upward mobility used by the Opportunity Atlas is the household income for 31-37 year olds, sorted based on what income percentile their parents were in. I specifically looked at those whose parents were in the 25th percentile, as a higher income for 31-37 year olds in this category equates to higher upward mobility. First, I manipulated the code to sort the information by county, so that I could look at differences across Massachusetts counties. Being a relatively small state, there are not too many counties, so it provides an interesting insight to look at that isn’t overwhelming. Then, I chose to look at how this category of upward mobility varied across counties in order to get a better understanding of the variable I was working with. Important to note, both Nantucket County and Dukes County, both having very few towns, have very few data points to work with. Looking at the data, Norfolk County, located just south of Boston, has the highest average upward mobility, though its neighbor that includes Boston, Suffolk County has a much lower average and quite a lot of variation. Though, while this violin plot shows how the variation in the variable differs across counties, it doesn’t give much more information than that and doesn’t show what drives these differences, like what makes Norfolk county the best place to live in regards to upward mobility.

Often one of the biggest predictors of future income is education, so I looked into how the fraction of individuals with a college degree in a county impacted the levels of upward mobility. As predicted, education, specifically college degrees, seems to have a positive correlation with upward mobility. Both Nantucket and Dukes county show a negative relationship, which is very interesting, though both have far fewer data points than the other counties, which likely contributes to this difference. While this likely could be due to the fact that obtaining a college degree is one of the best ways to increase upward mobility and income, this data also suggests that there might be community effects in play. More educated communities might be better at positively increasing future outcomes for children in the community as a whole. I wish that this data set had information on the high schools in Massachusetts, as I feel as though it would be really interesting to understand how high school education impacts upward mobility. I would’ve liked to know what school systems were best, if graduation rates impacted this

I then turned to looking at how upward mobility might differ across races. The data set had data for White, Hispanic, Black, and Asian individuals who were 31-37. While the Opportunity Atlas also takes in data on Native Americans, there was no Massachusetts data for this demographic. Something I didn’t love about this data set is how rigid their race data was, not allowing for any nuance or any other races beyond the five considered. Nonetheless, I looked at how the poverty rate in 1990 (indicative of the 31-37 year old’s childhood) impacted upward mobility by race. The data demonstrates that, across all races, poverty levels have a negative impact on upward mobility, as where there are higher rates of poverty there is less upward mobility, which is as expected. It should be noted here that, on average, Hispanic and Black 31-37 year olds have much lower levels of upward mobility, while Asian 31-37 year olds whose parents were in the 25th percentile have the highest levels of upward mobility and income.

Finally, one specific variable in the data set caught my attention: the share of single-headed households. Could the number of single parents impact the levels of upward mobility? I looked at this variable and separated it out into community zones so that the data could be more easily observed. As shown by the data in the most populated commuting zones (Boston, Providence, and Springfield), there looks to be a negative correlation between the two. Areas with more single parent households also have lower levels of upward mobility. This was very interesting, and I would like to learn more about this correlation in future studies. Perhaps this is linked to the amount of money or income going into a community/ into families in a community, as households with two working parents could theoretically have more income and more opportunities because of that (though in practice that isn’t always true).

The data provides a very interesting insight into what might impact upward mobility and what might make a community better for children to grow up in. Yet, there are many limitations to the dataset and to the work that could be done on this subject. For starters, the dataset does not specify whether or not these individuals grew up in these communities or if it is where they live now. It also has a limited number of variables, when there could be many correlates with upward mobility. It also treats individuals as data points and neglects the nuance and incredibly personal experiences related to upward mobility. For instance, how does having a mentor or an adult one can look up to help with upward mobility? These visualizations are also limited, as they showcase correlations, but nothing beyond that. They demonstrate that there could be a relationship between specific variables, but are unable to capture a full regression that controls for the effects of many variables. The graphs are also only limited to Massachusetts, a state that has strong education and relatively low rates of poverty, so the data could look vastly different across the country. As mentioned earlier, Suffolk county, among others, had a lot of variation in the data, so county and commuting zone data can’t quite capture all of the very minute differences in variation and the vast spread of the data. Yet, using towns made the data far too convoluted and indiscernible. 

Nonetheless, this topic is incredibly important in understanding how to break cycles of poverty or even just of lower income and could be very illuminative in how policies should approach helping individuals into higher income brackets and to better future outcomes. While it looks as though the “American Dream” is fading (though there certainly can be arguments made that it never existed in the first place), there are still ways to improve upward mobility by continuing this research and by making policy recommendations based off of the results.

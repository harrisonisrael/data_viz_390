CW: Gun violence, death, suicide


What forms of gun control are effective at reducing gun violence in the United States? How does gun violence and gun control differ across the United States? 

- Where are the highest rates of gun violence in the US? Where are the highest rates of gun ownership? Does the idea that "more guns = less crime" occur, or is that argument false and invalid? 
  - I would first want to look into if there is a correlation between rates of gun ownership and rates of gun violence 
  - I would also like to break down that first question into potentially the ways in which gun violence occured (self-inflicted, violent crime, etc). to seee if there is any correlation with suicide, as I know that one huge part of gun violence is related to this. 
  - I think that an interactive map related to mass shootings, similar to the bigfoot map we did in class, could be really interesting and informative, as to whether or not such incidents look random and are evenly distributive. This graph could be very informative, but also would be rather sad. I want to make sure that the project includes some information on the different ways gun violence presents itself in society (mass shootings, suicides, murders, etc).
- Do states/cities with lower rates of gun violence have different laws or policies?
  - I would really like to look into the different specific policies that are enacted in states. Are some better than others? Which ones look to be effective. The issue here is that there are lots of correlates that impact the data (for instance, republican-led states might be less likely to implement gun control laws AND might also have a higher percentage of guns in the state because of the voters present. it could be hard to make the determination that a state has more guns because there are less laws rather than the reverse correlation that theere are less laws because their voters own more guns). 
  - I also would want to try and see if there was a specific state I could use as a case study, looking at gun violence rates or ownership rates before and after they implemented a law to see if there was any change.

The visualizations I would use:
- Maps: This project definitely lends itself to some maps, especially with the interactive idea, but also maybe a map based on gun violence rates per state. 
- Scatter Plots: definitely would want to create some scatter plots to show the trends of gun ownership and rates of gun violence. 
- Histogram: Could use a histogram to look at what laws are most common across states (looking at the law on the x-axis and the number of states that adopted the legislation on the y-axis.
- Maybe others! So far those are the three ideas that I'm definitely going to look into. 

Data:
- https://everystat.org/methodology
  - Every Stat has a lot of interesting datasets broken down by intent, age, and location. I would like to use some of this data in my research. I would like to note that this website is pro gun safety, so I would want to double check and cross-reference the data before using it to ensure there are no biases. I would also like to redo their map on the homepage, as it is slightly hard to locate states on their setup.
- https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/firearm_mortality/firearm.htm
  - There is some limited data from the CDC that could be useful in the initial look at firearm deaths by state.
- https://www.statefirearmlaws.org/national-data
  - This source, from Boston University, breaks down the specific laws that each state has implemented up through 2018. 


Other idea: 
2) How has social media usage and subsequent polarization impacted new voters? 

- Are voters now less likely to believe that they can work with voters with differing views? 
- How are new voters voting? Who did those under 25 vote for in the 2020 presidential election? 
- How does youth voter turnout average recently compared to years prior?
